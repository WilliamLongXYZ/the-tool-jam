# the-tool-jam
My tool submission for The Tool Jam (https://itch.io/jam/the-tool-jam)
This tool does not follow the suckless philosophy, but rather, the suckmuch or suckmore philosophy. Cramming as much functionality into a single program as you possibly can, without caring much for efficiency. I might refactor my code later and put it into a proper tool that can actually be used for practical things.
